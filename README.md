# paper_review
This is to motivate me read more machine and deep learning papers and research and also share my findings by trying to answer the following question inspired by a lecture by Andre Ng.
1- What the author(s) try to accomplish?
2- What were the key elements of the approach?
3- What can you use yourself?
4- What other refrences do you want to follow?
